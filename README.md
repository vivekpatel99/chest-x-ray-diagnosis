# chest-x-ray-diagnosis

## Project Overview
ChestXpert is a state-of-the-art deep learning system designed to analyze chest X-ray images and detect multiple pathological conditions simultaneously. Built on DenseNet121 architecture and trained from scratch, this system achieves clinical-grade accuracy across 14 different chest conditions, making it a powerful tool for radiological diagnosis assistance.

 Key Features
Multi-label classification of 14 different chest pathologies

Custom-built DenseNet121 architecture trained from scratch on chest X-ray images

Hyperparameter optimization framework for finding optimal model configurations

Class imbalance handling through specialized weighted loss functions

Comprehensive evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC

Visualization tools for model interpretability using Grad-CAM
